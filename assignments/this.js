*
* 1. Global scope - When "this" is not pointing to anything created or rests in a fuction that is pointed in the global scope it will console log whatever is the browsers window or object.

     - the constructor function all the this keywords are activated when the object is created,
* 4. Explicit binding - 
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
